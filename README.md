Skirt and Shirt project for Miriam and Mark
===========================================

Idea: When the pandemic will be finally in a controlled state and parties are possible, Miriam wants to have a fancy
dress for the first party. There's been a couple of ideas for sewable electronics revolving in hear head for years and
now is the time to try them out. Mark joined the project because he always wanted to sew a dress with fancy electronics
and likes the idea of making it a party dress.

While Miriam is planning for a skirt, Mark is looking for a shirt or waistcoat. There are plenty of project ideas out
there - Miriam and Mark are explicitly looking for something interactive, so it should react to the party environment.

Current ideas:
-   A skirt that reacts on (dance?) movements, like https://hackaday.io/project/177255-neopixel-led-skirt
-   A waistcoat detecting touch of fellow dancers, using a capacitive touch sensor
